        <p>Thanks for your visit!

            
            I’m a political psychologist, working at the intersection of political communication, NLP, and psychology.<br><br>
            In my work, I explore narratives of political leaders with a specific focus on crisis moments, and I examine
            their persuasive effect on citizens. I apply methods of quantitative text analysis as well as visual conjoint
            survey designs.<br><br>
            In my recent projects, I also investigate the applicability of LLMs in social science research.<br><br>
            I’m a final year PhD researcher at the Hertie School and the SCRIPTS Cluster of Excellence. During my PhD, I
            was a visiting researcher at the European University Institute.<br><br>
            I’m always happy about new contacts and collaborations, please reach out!</p>
